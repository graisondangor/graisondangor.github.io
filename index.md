## Hi, I'm a journalist in New York.

In December I earned a master's in journalism from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. I specialized in business and economic reporting and in data journalism.

## I have reported for a number of outlets
Including Al Jazeera, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and The Bridge. Here are [some clips](https://graisondangor.github.io/clips).
