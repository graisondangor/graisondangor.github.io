Hi, I'm a reporter and newsletter writer in New York. 

As the sole writer for a cable news outlet's weekday newsletter, I grew subscribers past 400,000 while triplng its referral traffic to the website and growing ad revenue.

As a reporter, I have covered mental health, Covid-19, business, and breaking news for NPR, Kaiser Health News, Al Jazeera, and Forbes, where I also researched candidates for its _30 Under 30_ and _Next 1,000_ lists. Before moving to New York, I worked as a copywriter in Minneapolis.

The best way to reach me is <graison.dangor@gmail.com> or 347-567-6367.
