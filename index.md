## Hi, I'm a journalist in New York.

I report on how mental health is provided and paid for, and sometimes on other topics.

## My stories have appeared in ##

NPR, Kaiser Health News, Al Jazeera, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Financial Planning magazine, and The Bridge, a Brooklyn business newssite. Clips are below.

## I have a master's in journalism ##
from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY, where I specialized in business and economic reporting.
